# Better-GDQ
Chrome Extension that adds a footer to the GamesDoneQuick.com website that displays:
* Current run with links to the WR list on Speedrun.com and other leaderboards
* Links to the current runner or runners' Twitch.tv page
* Schedule of the next 1 to 5 speedruns at the click of a button

You can also enable an embed to place the #SDAMarathon channel chat on Quakenet-IRC next to the Twitch.tv player like during past GDQ marathons.
